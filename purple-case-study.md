# Purple Cool Touch Case Study
**Complete walkthrough of systematic AI evaluation in action**

## The Problem

As a sleep expert at Mattress Firm, I needed detailed specifications for the Purple Restore Cool Touch lineup - a Mattress Firm exclusive collection. Company SOPs and training materials lacked the technical depth customers and sales teams needed:

- No coil counts or construction details
- Missing competitive analysis data  
- Unverified claims about exclusivity
- No confidence levels for information accuracy

**Business Impact**: 2-3 hours of manual research per product family. Unreliable information. No systematic way to verify claims or scale research.

## The Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Problem Alignment with ChatGPT (15 minutes)

**Initial Conversation:**
```
Me: "I need comprehensive specifications for Purple Restore Cool Touch models. 
Our training materials are incomplete and I can't find reliable coil counts, 
construction details, or verification that this is truly Mattress Firm exclusive."

ChatGPT: "I understand you need detailed technical specs for sales and customer 
education. Let me help gather comprehensive information on the Cool Touch lineup..."
```

**Iterative Refinement**: Went back and forth until ChatGPT understood I needed:
- Verifiable technical specifications (coil counts, layer construction, weights)
- Source documentation with confidence levels
- Customer-safe vs internal-use information separation
- Structured output for future AI analysis

### Phase 2: Master Prompt Development (20 minutes)

Working with ChatGPT, I developed a master research prompt that specified:
- Exact information requirements (height, grid thickness, coil systems, weights)
- Source quality standards (official > retailer databases > forums)
- Output structure (JSON format for AI consumption)
- Evidence documentation (URL, claim, confidence level)

**Key Innovation**: Structured the prompt for "AI-first" design - outputs that future AI systems could easily process and validate.

### Phase 3: Multi-LLM Research Deployment (30 minutes)

Deployed identical prompt across 4 systems:
- **ChatGPT**: 23 documented specifications with evidence links
- **Claude**: 429 sources analyzed with detailed confidence levels  
- **Gemini**: 15 detailed technical specifications with regulatory citations
- **Perplexity**: Real-time web search with current retailer confirmations

**Total Research Time**: 30 minutes vs 3+ hours manual research

### Phase 4: Cross-Analysis and Quality Grading (45 minutes)

**Correlation Analysis**: Compared all outputs to identify consistent findings across systems.

**Evidence Grading System**:
- **High Confidence**: Purple.com official specs, Mattress Firm exclusivity confirmation, USPTO patents
- **Medium Confidence**: GoodBed database, Raymour & Flanigan listings, major retailer specs
- **Low Confidence**: Forum posts, unverified sources (excluded from customer-facing use)

**Key Findings**:
- All 4 LLMs confirmed 3" GelFlex Grid construction
- Coil counts validated across multiple retailer databases  
- Mattress Firm exclusivity verified through press releases
- Construction details cross-referenced with Purple patents

### Phase 5: Clean Output Generation (20 minutes)

**Final Specifications** (example for RestorePlus Cool Touch 13" Queen):

```json
{
  "spec_uid": "purple_restoreplus_cooltouch_13_queen",
  "brand": "Purple",
  "collection": "RestorePlus", 
  "retailer_variant": "Cool Touch",
  "model_display_name": "Purple RestorePlus Cool Touch 13\" Hybrid â€” Queen",
  "size": "Queen",
  "profile_height_in": 13,
  "grid_tech": {
    "type": "GelFlex Grid",
    "thickness_in": 3
  },
  "coil_system": {
    "type": "Zoned pocketed coils",
    "height_in": 8,
    "count_queen": 789,
    "edge_support": "Reinforced edge"
  },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "source": "Purple Official",
      "url": "https://purple.com/mattresses/restore-plus",
      "claim": "3\" GelFlex Grid construction",
      "confidence": "High"
    },
    {
      "source": "GoodBed Database", 
      "url": "https://goodbed.com/mattress/purple-restore-plus/",
      "claim": "Queen coil count: 789 pocketed coils",
      "confidence": "Medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Results and Validation

### Time Efficiency
- **Research Time**: 20 minutes vs 3 hours manual
- **Process Standardization**: Repeatable across product families
- **Multi-Model Coverage**: Complete lineup specifications in single session

### Quality Verification
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ match with manual expert research
- **Source Documentation**: Every claim backed by verifiable sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Clear separation of reliable vs uncertain information
- **Schema Compliance**: 100% structured data validation

### Business Impact
- **Customer Deployment**: Specifications ready for customer-facing use
- **Sales Training**: Technical details for competitive positioning
- **Process Replication**: Framework applicable to other mattress brands
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic validation replaced subjective assessment

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- **Multi-LLM Validation**: Cross-referencing eliminated single-system hallucinations
- **Evidence-Based Grading**: Confidence levels enabled customer-safe vs internal separation
- **AI-First Structure**: JSON output ready for automation and systematic reuse
- **Systematic Process**: Same methodology applicable across brands and products

### Key Insights
- **Correlation Over Individual Outputs**: Multiple AI systems finding same information = higher confidence
- **Source Quality Matters**: Official documentation beats aggregated databases beats forums
- **Structure Enables Scale**: Well-formatted outputs allow systematic comparison and validation
- **Process Documentation**: Methodology replication more valuable than single research result

## Replication Framework

This case study demonstrates the complete 5-phase framework:

1. **Problem Alignment**: Clear definition of information needs and quality standards
2. **Master Prompt Creation**: Structured research request deployable across systems  
3. **Multi-LLM Research**: Comprehensive information gathering with cross-validation
4. **Cross-Analysis**: Systematic quality grading and correlation analysis
5. **Clean Output**: Production-ready specifications with full audit trail

**The methodology transforms subjective AI evaluation ("does this sound right?") into systematic quality control ("can we prove this is accurate?").**

## Next Steps

This Purple Cool Touch research became the foundation for:
- Systematic evaluation framework applicable across industries
- Template prompts for mattress specification research
- Quality standards for customer-facing AI-generated content
- Training methodology for sales teams on technical product knowledge

The case study proves that systematic AI evaluation can deliver expert-level research quality at a fraction of the time and cost of manual processes.
