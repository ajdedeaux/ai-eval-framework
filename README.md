# AI Evaluation Framework
**Turn your messy AI problems into systematic solutions in 20 minutes**

## Start Here: Your Mess Is the Method

Got a research problem that's eating 3+ hours of your time? AI giving you answers you can't trust? Perfect. This framework was born from exactly that frustration.

**My original mess:** A rambling voice note about mattress specifications that no AI could get right.  
**The result:** A systematic framework that gets 95% accuracy in 20 minutes instead of 3 hours.  
**Your turn:** Start with YOUR mess. We'll show you how.

## The Problem This Solves

You ask AI for help. It sounds convincing. But is it right? You don't know, so you either:
- Spend hours manually verifying everything
- Deploy it and hope for the best
- Give up on AI for critical work

**This framework gives you the fourth option:** Systematic validation that proves AI accuracy.

## The 20-Minute Solution

After initial setup (60 minutes once), you can:

1. **Deploy** your research prompt across 4 AI systems simultaneously
2. **Find** consensus where multiple AIs agree (correlation = confidence)  
3. **Grade** evidence from HIGH (official sources) to LOW (forums)
4. **Generate** production-ready output with full audit trail

**Result:** 95% accuracy match with manual expert research. Every claim documented. Every source verified.

## Real Business Impact

### Before This Framework
- **Purple Mattress Research:** 3 hours manual research per product family
- **Accuracy:** "Does this sound right?" ðŸ¤·
- **Evidence:** Scattered notes, no verification
- **Scalability:** Zero. Start from scratch every time.

### After This Framework  
- **Time:** 20 minutes with systematic process
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ match with expert research
- **Evidence:** Every claim sourced with confidence levels
- **Scalability:** Repeatable process, works across domains

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Brain Dump Your Problem (5 min)
Don't organize. Don't structure. Just dump everything about your research problem into a text file. Seriously, the messier the better.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajdedeaux/ai-eval-framework
cd ai-eval-framework
cat START-HERE.md  # See my original mess and how to structure yours
```

### Step 2: Run Your First Research (20 min)
Once you've structured your mess (the framework helps you do this):

```
1. Open 20-minute-workflow.md
2. Copy the master research prompt  
3. Deploy to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
4. Run the consensus analysis
5. Get validated, evidence-backed results
```

### Step 3: See It Work
Check `purple-case-study.md` to see the complete journey from mess to systematic methodology.

## The Framework That Scales

### Works Across Industries
This isn't just for mattresses. Teams are using this for:
- **SaaS Evaluation:** Feature comparison, pricing analysis, vendor selection
- **Market Research:** Competitive intelligence, trend analysis, regulatory tracking  
- **Technical Documentation:** API specs, integration guides, security audits
- **Content Creation:** Product descriptions, training materials, knowledge bases

### Evidence-Based Validation
Stop asking "does this sound right?" Start proving accuracy:
- **Multi-Source Validation:** 4 AI systems cross-checking each other
- **Evidence Grading:** HIGH confidence (official) vs MEDIUM (databases) vs LOW (forums)
- **Consensus Analysis:** What 3+ systems agree on = higher confidence
- **Audit Trail:** Every claim linked to its source

### AI-First Design
Built for automation from day one:
- JSON-structured outputs for system integration
- Schema validation for quality gates
- Evidence chains for compliance requirements
- Deployment-ready separation (customer-safe vs internal)

---

## Why This Works

**The Insight:** Individual AI outputs are unreliable. But consensus across multiple AI systems, validated against authoritative sources, approaches expert-level accuracy.

**The Method:**
1. Same prompt â†’ 4 different AIs
2. Different perspectives â†’ Find overlaps
3. Grade evidence â†’ Trust official sources
4. Systematic validation â†’ Objective quality

**The Result:** Transform subjective guessing into measurable accuracy.

## The Philosophy

**Start messy.** Real problems aren't neat. Your brain dump is the raw material.

**Trust consensus.** One AI hallucinates. Four AIs agreeing approach truth.

**Demand evidence.** Every claim needs a source. Every source needs a confidence level.

**Ship confidently.** When you can prove accuracy, you can move fast without breaking things.
