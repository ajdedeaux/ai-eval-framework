# AI Evaluation Framework
**Stop guessing if AI output is good. Start measuring it.**

## The Problem

Your team generates AI content and asks "Does this sound right?" That's not scalable, measurable, or reliable. When AI fails in production, you don't know why.

## The Solution

A systematic 5-phase framework that turns subjective evaluation into objective measurement. Proven to reduce research time by 85% while maintaining 95%+ accuracy.

## Real Results

**Mattress Specification Research:**
- **Before**: 3 hours of manual research per product
- **After**: 20 minutes with systematic AI evaluation
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ match with expert research
- **Output**: Production-ready specifications with full audit trail

## How It Works

1. **Problem Alignment** - Get AI to understand your exact needs
2. **Master Prompt Creation** - Build one prompt that works across multiple AIs  
3. **Multi-LLM Research** - Deploy across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
4. **Cross-Analysis** - Compare outputs, grade sources, find truth
5. **Clean Output** - Generate structured, customer-safe data

**Total time: 1 hour vs 3+ hours manual. Same quality, systematic process.**

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-evaluation-framework
cd ai-evaluation-framework
```

**Then:**
1. Read [`purple-case-study.md`](purple-case-study.md) - see the complete example
2. Copy [`research-prompt.md`](research-prompt.md) - adapt for your domain
3. Follow [`20-minute-workflow.md`](20-minute-workflow.md) - execute the process
4. Use [`validation-prompt.md`](validation-prompt.md) - ensure quality

## What You Get

- **Copy-paste prompts** that work across multiple AI systems
- **Validation framework** with objective quality metrics  
- **Real case study** showing 20-minute research replacing 3-hour manual process
- **Evidence standards** that separate reliable from unreliable information
- **Structured outputs** ready for automation and scale
