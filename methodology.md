## The Problem

Most teams evaluate AI by asking "Does this sound right?" This doesn't scale, can't be measured, and fails in production.

## The 5-Phase Solution

### 1. Problem Alignment (5 min)
Chat with your preferred LLM until you both understand exactly what you need to research.

### 2. Master Prompt Creation (10 min)  
Build one research prompt that works across multiple LLMs. Structure outputs for AI consumption.

### 3. Multi-LLM Research (15 min)
Run the same deep research prompt on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. Collect all outputs.

### 4. Cross-Analysis & Grading (20 min)
Compare outputs, grade sources (High/Medium/Low confidence), find commonalities.

### 5. Clean Output Generation (10 min)
Produce structured, customer-safe data with audit trail.

**Total Time: 60 minutes vs 3+ hours manual**

## Key Principles

- **AI-First**: Structure everything for future automation
- **Evidence-Based**: Every claim needs sources with confidence levels
- **Systematic**: Same process works across domains
- **Business-Focused**: Quality metrics tied to real outcomes

## Quick Start

1. Read [`purple-case-study.md`](purple-case-study.md) - see it work
2. Copy [`research-prompt.md`](research-prompt.md) - customize for your domain  
3. Follow [`20-minute-workflow.md`](20-minute-workflow.md) - execute the process
4. Use [`validation-prompt.md`](validation-prompt.md) - ensure quality

That's it. No complexity, just results.
